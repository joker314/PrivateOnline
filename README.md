# PrivateOnline

As You enter the room, so does She. You leave. So does She. You enter another room. So does She. You run. She runs. You sit down. So does she. Tracking you. You enter a room labelled "Me Only". She follows. She is real. She is isOnline.

And then there's PrivateOnline. You enter a room. She remains, respecting you, understanding you. You enter another. She doesn't. You leave. She doesn't. You do whatever you want; whatever you expect to be private. She looks away and do only as you ask. She fetches the status you want without peeking at why you want to know this or who you want to know. She doesn't tell her Parents. She keeps it to herself and then forgets it as soon as she passes back the result.

We believe in Your privacy.
